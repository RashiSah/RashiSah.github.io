title: 2021. Let's get it started!
---

A super awesome Sunday in London and here I was sitting in my balcony sipping my coffee enjoying this winter's very first snowfall this morning. It's been 4 months since I started my job and moved to this city.

And now it's almost 5 in the evening and I am reading a book called - Who will ry when you die - Robin Sharma. So far so good. One of my friends recommended it to me. Very nicely written and finest peices of words used in the book. I am not even halfway there reading it. The perfect thing I liked about this book are short lessons of life comprised in form of chapters, 101 beautiful chapters which are actually very important to understand to live a quality life.
I will try to write short learnings or name of chapters from the book while I continue reading it along the way.

- Learn from a good movie
- bless your money whenever you send it out
- Focus on the worthy - concentrate on the fundamentals - the person who chases two rabbits catches neither.
- Carry a book with you always - helps while queuing in long lines and travelling ;)
- LISTEN
