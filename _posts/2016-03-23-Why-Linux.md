The Linux collaborative project was started by Linus Torvalds long back in 1991. While he didn’t intend to develop it as an open source project, with time, the project gained popularity and eventually became one of the world’s largest collaborative projects.

Today, Linux is used everywhere around us. Linux acts as a foundation of our digital life that’s governed by search engines like Google, Android smart phones, social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter, ATMs, and a lot more.

You might also be knowing that Linux is the king of supercomputers and it powers the majority of them.
