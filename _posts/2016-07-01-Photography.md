When I was a child, I always wanted to store somehow each and every happy moment of my life and surroundings so that I can restore them later. For now, what I like about photographs is that they capture a moment thatâ€™s gone forever, impossible to reproduce. I really love photography. I like to capture all the special or sober moments of my life in a camera's folder that is at present in my phone. Whenever I go to a new place and found beautiful things around, I just take out my phone from the pocket to click the pictures and to store them forever.Beauty can be seen in all things, seeing and composing the beauty is what separates the snapshot from the photograph. I believe that once photography enters your bloodstream, it is like a disease. Yes it is, in fact this disease is increasing day by day.. The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do.

Here I would like to share some of my clicked photos-
